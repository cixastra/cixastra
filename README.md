That all aside, I think I have a very interesting life. I am learning Javascript, and soon HTML. I know how to use Fusion360, Autodesk Inventor, and Onshape. Pretty much any 3D modeling software (not animation). I have recently been using [Autocode *(formerly STLIB/Standard Library)*](https://autocode.com) to code discord bots and other automations. As well as learning Java with Idea by Jetbrains. Thx [Github for education](https://education.github.com).
